# speed-guess

Welcome to Speed Guess!
This is a console-based game. As the name mentions the user will have to guess the speed of the given type of spacecraft propulsion. 
For each round, the name and a brief description of the type of propulsion system is given. The user then gets a chance to guess the 
speed of the spacecraft using that propulsion system. After the user inputs their guess, the program will then check to see if they 
guessed the correct number. If guessed correctly, the user will be taken to the next round; otherwise the user has a chance to keep 
guessing repeatedly until they get the correct answer. Throughout this process, the game provides the user appropriate feedback based
on their guess. For example, if the guess is too high, the game might output a message indicating that the guess was too high and 
suggests the user to try a lower value next time. The user also has a chance to quit guessing and reveal the correct answer. Once all 
the rounds have been completed, the game will end.
